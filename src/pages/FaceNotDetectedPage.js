                    For a smooth experience, please find your way to the marked area on the ground.

                    Look straight into the camera lens, ensuring your face is fully in view.
                    Remember to remove any accessories like hats or sunglasses that might cover your face,
                    and if your hair is falling over your eyes, please push it back.

                <p>
                    Keeping a relaxed, neutral face helps us recognize you better.
                    We appreciate your patience and cooperation.
